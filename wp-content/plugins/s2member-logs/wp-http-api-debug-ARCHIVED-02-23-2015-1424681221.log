				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>This version brings in the long waited support for creating products in secondary languages without first having to exist in the default language but also several other changes and improvements.</strong></p>
<h2>Added support for creating products in secondary languages only.</h2>
<p>Up until this version each product had to first be created in the default language in order for it to also be created in a different language (translated).</p>
<div id="attachment_551403" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-551403" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image02.png?2899a6" alt="image02" width="500" height="385" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Selecting the language for a new product</p></div>
<p>Now you can select the language of the product at the moment when it is created or change the language afterwards just like for the regular posts translation in WPML.</p>
<p>In the example above, you can see how using the native editor it’s possible to set the language for a product to French which is not the default language.</p>
<p>In the WooCommerce Multilingual products translation page, the interface has been changed to accommodate the fact that the original language of the products can be any language of the active languages of the site.</p>
<div id="attachment_551406" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-551406" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image01.png?2899a6" alt="image01" width="500" height="332" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Products in different languages on the products translation screen.</p></div>
<p>Along with the changes for the products, product categories, product tags and any other taxonomies associated with product can be created and exist alone in secondary languages.</p>
<div id="attachment_551411" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-551411" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image03.png?2899a6" alt="Setting the language for products taxonomies" width="500" height="489" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Setting the language for products taxonomies</p></div>
<h2>Added enhancements for the Woocommerce Multilingual products table (filter by original language, display language flag).</h2>
<p>The new language options introduced the need to add some new design elements. At the top of the products translation screen, you can filter products to be listed by a specific language and also chose to only see translations in a specific language (useful when your site has many secondary languages).</p>
<div id="attachment_551415" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-551415" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image04.png?2899a6" alt="Filtering the products by language and translations." width="500" height="386" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Filtering the products by language and translations.</p></div>
<h2>Added option to synchronize the products and product taxonomies order.</h2>
<p>This new option that is ‘on’ by default allows one to set a custom order for the products in the shops in each different language. This especially comes handy for a site with a mix between products in different languages that are not translation of each others and products that have translations.</p>
<div id="attachment_551416" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-551416" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image00.png?2899a6" alt="The option to synchronize products and product taxonomies display order." width="500" height="238" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The option to synchronize products and product taxonomies display order.</p></div>
<h2>Some of the bugs fixed:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cart was not updating quantities for variable product (when have more than one variable in the cart).</li>
<li>The cart total was not updating when using get_cart_total() and get_cart_subtotal() functions in other plugins or themes.</li>
<li>Wrong price format and order total were displayed on the new order page in the WP admin.</li>
<li>The featured image and the gallery images were overridden when updating translations.</li>
<li>Fixed the &#8216;Keep&#8217; option (under multi-currency options) that allows keeping the same currency on the front end, when switching the language.</li>
<li>Fixed a javascript error that was showing when changing currencies order.</li>
<li>The decimal number was not working correctly for the default currency.</li>
<li>Fixed a compatibility problem with WooCommerce Product Tabs.</li>
<li>A coupon was applied incorrectly to all products in the cart when they were defined for specific product variations.</li>
<li>WooCommerce note email language was not correct.</li>
<li>WooCommerce reports were showing duplicate products.</li>
<li>When using WordPress in a folder, the checkout showed an &#8216;expired session&#8217; error message.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A little something for the developers</h2>
<p>Added support currency argument in raw_price_filter. This allows one to display prices in a different currency than the current currency on the page. e.g. display a custom list of prices without using a ‘list-type’ layout of the currency selector.</p>
<h2>Download or upgrade</h2>
<p>You can get <a href="https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/woocommerce-multilingual.3.5.zip">WooCommerce Multilingual 3.5</a> from the WordPress plugins directory and you are welcome to add and we’d love to hear your feedback here on any problems you may have on our <a href="http://wpml.org/forums/topic-tag/woocommerce/">support forum</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>You might have noticed today, an unfortunate addition to WPML&#8217;s cost. Due to new regulations in the EU, we are required to collect VAT for WPML, when selling to individuals (without a VAT number) in the EU.</strong></p>
<p>We realize that this increases the cost of WPML for some of you and we are not happy about this. The additional money isn&#8217;t going to us, but to the EU. We tried to avoid this, but the new regulations, which started a few days ago, are strict.</p>
<p>No matter if we are in the EU or not, we have to add VAT when selling to EU customers without a VAT number. Besides the added cost, you can imagine that this is also complicating us, adding more engineering and bureaucracy (to report and pay VAT to the EU).</p>
<p>The only thing left for us to do is to hope that EU countries will put this money to good use.</p>
<p>If you are a business, registered in the EU and have a VAT number, be sure to enter it to our checkout page, so that we don&#8217;t have to charge you VAT.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We are very happy to announce a first beta of WPML 3.1.9, which works great with object caching. If you are looking for significantly better performance for big sites with many strings, this is for you.</strong></p>
<p>WPML&#8217;s String Translation does a very important function, allowing you to translate strings without having to go through .mo files. This is especially important for dynamic strings, which are created in the database and not stored in PHP code.</p>
<p>WPML 3.1.9 is the first step towards a massive performance improvement. In this step, we allow object caching plugins to catch repeating accesses and eliminate them. We experimented with different caching techniques and eventually settled on the best performer &#8211; &#8216;no caching in WPML&#8217;. This might be a bit surprising, but it actually makes sense. Caching plugins try to group operations and store them in memory as bigger and faster chunks. When WPML tried to cache strings itself, it caused the object caching to be useless.</p>
<p>In this release, we&#8217;ve cleaned up our caching completely, optimized our database access and made everything accessible to object caching. This helps simplify our logic (less PHP processing, less chances of glitches) and it also allows object caching to do its job.</p>
<p>Many sites will barely see the performance improvement because the String Translation&#8217;s load wasn&#8217;t a huge part of the overall page load. Some sites that have a lot of strings will see a significant improvement. Even without object caching, they should already have far fewer database queries. And, they have a potential to see yet greater improvement by enabling object caching.</p>
<h2>How to Enable Object Caching with W3TC</h2>
<p>Object caching takes a bit of planning and setup. Here is an inventory list of the elements you&#8217;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>An opcache PHP plugin (not to be confused with a WordPress plugin)
<ul>
<li>For PHP &lt; 5.5 =&gt; use APC, set enough memory (128MB+ for larger sites( WCML mostly ) are a good idea), in production set apc.stat active
<ul>
<li>Users who know what they&#8217;re doing could also try to exclude sitepress.class and other very large files of ours from APC, this could bring considerable gains</li>
<li>Install via pecl</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For PHP &gt;= 5.5 =&gt; use ZendOpcache, it&#8217;s currently faster and much easier to configure
<ul>
<li>install via pecl or during compilation of PHP</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In W3TC itself
<ul>
<li>Select your used OpCache plugin for the various caching options ( Database, Object etc..), Don&#8217;t use Harddrive here anywhere!</li>
<li>Careful with the gZip settings for the output ( this seems to rather slow things down unless you have a strong CPU)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PHP configuration:
<ul>
<li>Set enough RAM</li>
<li>Activate the PHP query cache ( not strictly related to W3TC, but it helps a ton in some spots)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MySQL configuration:
<ul>
<li>If you don&#8217;t have any tricky memcached setup =&gt; try the MySQL query cache, it should provide significant gains especially with the new ST</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Download and Try WPML 3.1.9</h2>
<p>As this is a beta version, you need to download it manually. Log in to your <a href="https://wpml.org/account/">WPML.org account</a> and click on Downloads.</p>
<p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and get the CMS Beta Package. This is a ZIP that includes other ZIPs. Unzip it locally. Now, you can either upload the ZIP files to WordPress (which will extract them), or extract yourself and save in the plugins folder.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>We just released Gravity Forms Multilingual 1.2.1. This version includes improvements to translation of Gravity Forms, as well as fixes for a few glitches.</strong></p>
<h3>Filtering Gravity Forms translation jobs</h3>
<p>Filtering Gravity Forms translation jobs has been improved on the WPML Translation Management Dashboard screen. Support has been added for the following fields: ‘From Language’ (Gravity Forms are always in the default language), ‘To Language,’ ‘Translation status,’ ‘Filter: Type,’ and ‘Filter: Title.’</p>
<div id="attachment_544031" style="width: 234px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6754912-e1421422819144.png?2899a6"><img class="wp-image-544031 size-medium" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/6754912-e1421422819144-224x300.png?2899a6" alt="Filtering Gravity Forms translation jobs" width="224" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Translation Management Dashboard</p></div>
<h3>Fixed translation of HTML content field type</h3>
<p>The HTML content field type string name was not registered correctly in WPML String Translation. There was a doubled form ID in the registered string name, e.g., ‘3_3_field-1-content’ instead of ‘3_field-1-content.’</p>
<div id="attachment_544035" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-st-screen-html-field-error.png?2899a6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544035" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-st-screen-html-field-error-300x205.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed translating HTML content field type" width="300" height="205" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">String Translation screen showing HTML field type</p></div>
<h3>Fixed translation of the option labels for radio, checkbox, and select field types</h3>
<p>The radio, checkbox, and select field option labels were not registered correctly in WPML String Translation if the string length exceeded 128 characters. This resulted in a translation mismatch and the handler was added on the GFML side.</p>
<div id="attachment_544036" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-translation-editor-error.png?2899a6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544036" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-translation-editor-error-300x196.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed translating option labels for radio, checkbox and select field types" width="300" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Translation Editor screen</p></div>
<div id="attachment_544038" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-st-screen-label-error.png?2899a6"><img class="wp-image-544038 size-medium" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-st-screen-label-error-e1421423706534-300x164.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed translating option labels for radio, checkbox and select field types 2" width="300" height="164" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">String Translation screen</p></div>
<h3>Fixed the broken HTML and JS on the Translation Editor screen when the field label contains HTML content</h3>
<p>If the radio, checkbox, and select field option labels contained HTML, the HTML and JS were broken on the Translation Editor screen. A sanitization method has been added on the GFML side, which filters the string name to ensure safe usage.</p>
<div id="attachment_544040" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-translation-editor-error1.png?2899a6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544040" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/screenshot-translation-editor-error1-300x196.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed broken HTML and JS on Translation Editor screen when field label contains HTML content" width="300" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Translation Editor screen</p></div>
<h3>Fixed the issues with Price fields during string registration and translation</h3>
<p>The Price fields were not registered and translated correctly. Thus, handling has been improved for all the Price fields. Note that Gravity Forms only allows the default currency and it is not possible to change the currency on the translated form at present.</p>
<div id="attachment_544046" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-12_2044.png?2899a6"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544046" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2014-12-12_2044-279x300.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed issues with Price Fields string registration and translation" width="279" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gravity Form Product field</p></div>
<div id="attachment_544050" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forms--E2-80-B9-QA-OnTheGo-Systems--E2-80-94-WordPress-2014-12-12-20-42-20.png?2899a6"><img class="wp-image-544050 size-medium" src="http://d2salfytceyqoe.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Forms--E2-80-B9-QA-OnTheGo-Systems--E2-80-94-WordPress-2014-12-12-20-42-20-e1421423917882-300x195.png?2899a6" alt="Fixed issues with Price Fields string registration and translation 2" width="300" height="195" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gravity Form Shipping field</p></div>

There are a couple of invoices still to come in so I\'ll write back with an updated version shortly. \\n\\nBy way of explanation: it would have been very difficult to have asked providers to charge each institution separately. I therefore calculated each organisation\'s share of the cost as a percentage of the cost of the works falling in BC or Common areas. ULIP\'s 50% share of costs for common areas works out to be 27% of total works. I\'ve therefore applied that percentage to all costs except where the asset or service was clearly shared (ex. lifts).\\n\\nPlease do come back to me if you have any queries.\\n\\nBest

If you are not that person please let me know, if you can provide me with the name of the member of staff who is, I would greatly appreciate it. If you need a reminder of your safety roles and responsibilities and for other staff, here is the LINK (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/saforg.aspx).\\n\\nI\'m attaching the links to some new supportive guidance related to domestic accommodation (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/Accommodation.aspx). So if part of your role is to maintain or arrange the maintenance of British Council houses or flats; give advice to staff looking for accommodation, or simply providing advice about peoples\' homes, then this will be useful. You can add the information to any existing arrangements you already use.\\n\\nThe British Council has a Duty of Care to many groups of staff regarding domestic accommodation, the greatest is where we own or rent the property and require staff to live there, however we have some level of duty across various situations.\\n\\nThere are two new guidance documents Gas (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/GasinAccomodation.aspx) and Electricity (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/ElectricityinAccomodation.aspx) in Domestic Accommodation to add to the Fire (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/Accommodation_Fire_Safety.aspx) guidance for domestic accommodation sent out last year - these are aimed at staff who have a role in arranging and managing British Council accommodation, although there is plenty of good advice for staff wanting a safer home.\\n\\nThe third new document here is an accommodation checklist (http://intranet.britishcouncil.org/Risk/ERM/HealthandSafety/Pages/Accommodation.aspx) for staff looking for accommodation, especially designed with Teachers in mind, although could be used by anyone looking for or in existing accommodation. The checklist is not exhaustive but identifies plenty of safety indicators.\\n\\nPlease could you use this guidance as widely as possible and share it with staff as appropriate, perhaps in your next staff or management meeting.\\n\\nFeedback gratefully received.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you, and will be in contact with you soon regarding accident reporting.\\n\\nAlternative contacts in my team are Alan, Alan.Oakley-Jones@britishcouncil.org who is the corporate H&S Advisor and Tony Anthony.Jones@britishcouncil.org who is the corporate Fire Protection Manager.\\n\\nBest wishes\\n\\nDaniel\\n\\nDaniel Curtin | Head, Health and Safety | British Council | 10 Spring Gardens | London SW1A 2BN\\nDDI: + 44 (0)20 7389 4532 | BCTN: 010 4532 | M: + 44 (0) 7824 864234 | E: daniel.curtin@britishcouncil.org\\n\\nwww.britishcouncil.org (http://www.britishcouncil.org/)\\n\\nThe British Council is the United Kingdom\'s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities.

Michael.\\n\\nHi Michael,\\n\\nI\'m wondering whether you could have chat with this agent to see how much negotiation there is to be had over this apartment. It\'s a good location for us but only 1st floor (so pretty close to the market when that\'s on) no balconies and really needs new bathrooms so it seems very expensive right now but hasn\'t been let despite being on the market for over 3 months (I saw it in November and it was already empty then). This is the email i sent him but haven\'t had a reply to. His mobile is 06 12 80 49 64 and he seems very approachable. His name is Monsieur Lefebure\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nRachel\\n\\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\\nFrom: Rachel Wheatley <wheatley.rachel@gmail.com>\\nDate: 2015-02-05 23:07 GMT+01:00\\nSubject: Re: visite 16heures\\nTo: CARNOT IMMOBILIER <carnot-immobilier@wanadoo.fr>\\n\\nCher Monsieu Lefébure,\\n\\nMerci pour le visite a 30 Ave de Saxe aujourd hui. Nous sommes intéressants à cet appartement, mais il me semble très cher par rapport aux autres sur le marché actuellement. Notre position est que nous sommes à la recherche pour une longue appartement terme être utilisée par le Directeur du British Council et les directeurs successifs. L\'appartement actuelle que nous vivons a été loué à une compagnie d\'assurance (qui a vendu il ya deux ans pour dvelopers de propriété) depuis plus de 40 ans, donc cette continuité offre une excellente proposition financière pour un propriétaire qui souhaite revenu continu, sans périodes vides. Notre appartement au moment a été loué en cours depuis plus de 40 ans et dans ce temps, il a été très bien entretenu et amélioré par le British Council depuis qu\'ils ont commencé louaient.\\n\\nJ\'ai expliqué que nous étions sur le point de signer le contrat sur un apartment de très bonne qualité, récemment rénové, détenue par une compagnie d\'assurance, sur l\'avenue de la Bourdonnais, mais malgré ses cinq chambres et 3 receptions, il a relativement petite cuisine. Il se rendit d\'abord sur le marché il ya au moins 10 mois pour € 6000 cc (chauffage et l\'eau chaud) mais ils ont baissé le prix de € 4100 + 750charges (l\'eau chaud et chauffage inclus) et nous ont offert une période de loyer gratuit pour se adapter à une cuisine. J\'aime l\'appartement au 30, avenue de Saxe, mais il se sent un peu plus petit (avez vous un bon plan pour vérifier le m2?) et ne est pas aussi immaculée que celui sur Bourdonnais mais c\'est près de l\'école de mon fils et pas loin du British Council (Rue Constantine). Nous pouvons rester dans notre appartement actuel jusqu\'à ce que Mars 2016 mais également nous pouvons partir immédiatement (préavis d\'un mois). J\'ai vu un autre grand appartement sur l\'avenue de Saxe laquelle l\'agent a été incapable de louer pour plusieurs mois à € 4500 en dépit d\'être bien sur le 4ème étage et très lumineux et calme. L\'agent m\'a dit qu\'ils aimeraient négocier mais je pense qu\'il y a peut être trop de travail à faire là-bas. Avec l\'appartement au 30, avenue de Saxe je crois qu\'il y a moins de travail, mais nous aimerions repolir parquet, repeindre où nécessaire , adapter à une bonne douche de qualité et d\'améliorer une salle de bains en général, et aussi améliorer une WC pour les invitees. Nous ne pouvons pas payer plus que nous avons actuellement mis d\'accord sur l\'appartement de Bourdonnais mais ce est avec tout charges comprises. Pouvez-vous confirmer ce qui est inclus dans les charges de 30 Ave Saxe et comment cher vous envisager chauffage au gaz et de l\'eau chaude pour être si elles ne sont pas inclus se il vous plaît? Nous sommes une famille avec un enfant de 6 ans. Si le propriétaire est heureux de discuter de l\'amélioration de l\'appartement dans une manière coopérative et amicable avec nous (nous avons constructeurs employées par le British Council qui nous pourrions utiliser) et serait prêt à abaisser le loyer nous serions interesees de parler avec vous. Si oui, est-ce mon mari peut voir l\'appartement aussitôt que possible?\\n\\nCordialement\\n\\nRachel Wheatley\\n\\n2014-12-01 10:57 GMT+01:00 Rachel Wheatley <wheatley.rachel@gmail.com>:\\n\\nMerci pour le visite a Avenue Saxe.

Many places also include the heating so obviously we could afford more for a place including these things. I have seen a lot of places are coming down in price so a flat advertised at 5100 in perfect location with parking and heating included that came down in price to under 5000 might well be within the budget).

events","description":"Dear All,\\n\\nLast week I met with Michael Smutts and Romain to talk about our needs for facilities support for events and courses in the building.\\n\\n· Michael has agreed to prepare a template form for booking facilities support in advance for an event. This will be a checklist to cover all options – room layout, catering, etc.\\n\\n· I have also asked that we build in a ‘buffer’ time so that rooms are ready at least 1 hour before our event is due to start. This would give us the assurance we need to host an event with confidence.\\n\\n· The good news is that the Facilities team will shortly be taking over room booking as well, introducing a new system. We have agreed to also build some checks into the system to ensure that high profile events are not booked back to back, leaving no time to change rooms around.\\n\\n· Facilities will also invest a bit of time in compiling an inventory of our kitchen equipment to save time when arranging catering etc.\\n\\n· We tabled a conversation about internal facilities support for a later stage as this is also relevant to other teams, and there was enough to tackle with the external event support.\\n\\nRomain and Michael have said they will try harder to have a broader view of the day’s events so that they can respond to questions about an event happening later in the day. They stressed that they are genuinely committed to helping us host high quality events in the BC and that they hoped some comments at recent events were said out of frustration rather than a belief that they are not interested.\\n\\nPlease continue to put in booking requests as before until you get an alternative template. Michael has also introduced a system to escalate and to rate your zendesk requests, so please use that as well – not forgetting to give positive ratings when we do receive excellent and fast service from our facilities colleagues.\\n\\nAll the best, Julia\\n\\nJulia Handelman-Smith | Head of Programmes and Partnerships\\nBritish Council France\\n\\n9 rue de Constantine, 75007 Paris, France\\nT + 33 (0)1 49 55 73 30 | BCTN 271 7330 | M + 33 (0)6 84 51 40 20\\nhttp://www.britishcouncil.fr | http://www.educationuk.fr\\nFacebook BritishCouncilFrance (https://www.facebook.com/BritishCouncilFrance) | Twitter @fr_british (https://twitter.com/fr_british)\\n\\nThe British Council is the United Kingdom\'s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities.

Since then I\'ve completed a 1st draft of a document that sets out who is responsible for what in the building and how the two organisations should interact in relation to these common needs - I\'ll get the final version to you by Monday at the latest. We have also identified some potential service providers and Charles has kindly offered his help to define the scope of services required (see his email below). As discussed yesterday, I don\'t think that we should follow Ulip\'s lead on this one; I just can\'t see the need for an expert to visit the building once a week. Local regulations are what they are but we need to make an informed assessment of the needs first.\\n\\nMy recommendation would be to proceed as follows:\\n\\n- complete document that identifies needs and responsibilities\\n\\n- ask service provider (ex. bureau de controle) to ensure document covers all regulatory requirements, update if necessary\\n\\n- prepare scope of services required going forward (perhaps including a visit once every two months or per quarter)\\n\\n- identify what coverage there already is and any blind spots\\n\\n- carry out tend process to appoint a service provider for monitoring of regulations and advice on how to ensure full compliance\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMichael\\n\\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\\nFrom:\\nDate: Friday, June 28, 2013\\nSubject: Technical review: Serious aircon and electrical issues\\nTo: solutions@foris-scientia.com, Andrew.Burlton@britishcouncil.fr\\n\\nDear Mike,\\n\\nThis is useful and very clear. Well done\\n\\nI tend to agree with your recommendations\\n\\na) to have the a/c system reviewed to see what corrective measures, and at what magnitude of cost, might be necessary. e\\n\\nb) existing electrical plan to be prepared It would be sensible to look at the whole of the building to ensure the electrics is fully safe. You will need Joanne prior approval to share the cost..\\n\\nc) H&S compliance – again necessary but will need Joanne prior approval to allow you to manage the tender process and appoint.\\n\\nd) ERP (max total number in the building at any one time). As you know the is a limit on the max no of people allowed in the building at any one time. It would be sensible, if with Joanne prior approval, that there is a manual check done on the busiest day of the week (Wednesday?) to establish whether at any time during that day the limit is exceeded. I suspect we are within the 700 target figure but at least once a year there should be data gathered through a manual check to support this view.\\n\\nI can help with a) and b) in developing a scope of services so that so that fee proposal can be obtained but first up you need Andrew’s/Joanne’s agreement that this something worth doing and that ULIP will pick up its fair share of any relevant joint appointments..\\n\\n.\\n\\nCharles\\n\\nFrom: solutions Foris Scientia [solutions@foris-scientia.com]\\nSent: 20 June 2013 21:30\\nTo: Burlton, Andrew (France); McLean, Charles (France)\\nSubject: Technical review: Serious aircon and electrical issues\\n\\nDear Andrew,\\n\\nWe spoke briefly about these issues earlier this week.

I\'ve managed to find a system I used with my company back in 2009, the person checking the rooms basically walked with checklist and ticked off the checks one by one. At the end of the checks they added the data to a spreadsheet for analysis. I\'m attaching the spreadsheet, see \\"list of checks\\" and \\"procedure\\" tabs.

The case in point is the role of the chief fire officer for the 3rd floor. As this is a new document I\'d like to have your comments and would like to send it to the fire officer in London for comments as well. Once it has been signed off my recommendation would be to proceed as follows:\\n\\n- complete procedures for chief and assistant fire officers for each floor and procedures for each classroom (I\'d need a couple of days to complete them)\\n\\n- organise a training for chief/assistant fire officers and teachers\\n\\n- organise a fire drill based on the new procedures for the week of the 9th December\\n\\n- ensure these procedures are available on the intranet and in class files\\n\\n- ensure all employees have drawn up a PEEP (personal emergency evacuation plan) and are fully aware of all emergency procedures and that it is part of their deliverables\\n\\nPlease note the procedure for people with reduced mobility is not sufficient at present but I\'ve just received confirmation from London that an evac-chair specially designed for descending stairs could be a viable option - see here if you want to see it in action: http://www.evac-chair.co.uk/Video.aspx.\\n\\nI\'ve also looked at the potential numbers of people using a particular exit (main stairs, fire escapes etc..) and would like to check that those numbers are realistic in an emergency situation. A bureau de contrôle or specialised consultant will be able to provide a binding response.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMichael\\n\\n--\\n\\nMichael Smuts | Foris Scientia UK Ltd\\n\\nActing on behalf of:\\n\\nBritish Council France, 9 rue de Constantine | 75340 Paris Cedex 07\\nGB +44 (0)800 011 9639 | Mobile +33 (0)623850356\\n\\n(z&&__98)\\n\\nThe British Council is the United Kingdom\'s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities.

Help with general problems i.e. Andrea was dealing with the lack of technology in three classrooms today\\n\\nIT: make sure computers are working, dealing with printer problems (today we have 3 computers down – Crystal, Purple, ULIP105 and both printers not working, and no IT person around to deal with these issues). IT support needs to be around at 8.00 / 8.30 so he can deal with problems early in the morning so teaching activity to take place in best possible conditions. Also, we need at least 5 backup CD players (and easy access to CDs) and a white board in all classrooms.\\n\\nManagement: we need at least two STs AM and 2 STs PM to deal with teachers i.e. answer queries, check that teachers are all in, arrange cover when necessary and help the cover teacher, ensure they are in class 10 mins before class.\\n\\nCover: we know about this one!\\n\\nAt the moment Andrea is doing all of the above on St at 8.00 AM.\\n\\nNayr Ibrahim\\n\\nAssistant Teaching Centre Manager | Manager Bilingual Section T + 33 (0)1 49 55 73 31 | BCTN 271 73 31 | F + 33 (0)1 47 05 77 02 British Council, 9 rue de Constantine, 75007 Paris, France http://www.britishcouncil.fr <http://www.britishcouncil.org/fr/france>\\n\\nCultural relations promotes equality and values diversity | Creating Opportunity for People Worldwide Help save paper - do you need to print this email?\\n\\nThe British Council believe that all children have potential and that every child matters - everywhere in the world.

The door to our resource room was left unlocked on Saturday.\\n\\n· A teacher from Ste Clotilde reported this to Amy.\\n\\n· We store our BC laptops & photocopier & all our resources & stationery, registers etc etc\\n\\n· The students of Ste Clotilde and teaching staff therefore had access to this\\n\\n· Please report this incident to Vinci\\n\\n· This is serious misconduct in terms of his contractual role profile and we would like to replace this security guard immediately\\n\\n2. The furniture in our ‘staff room’ was not put back last night & Amy received a complaint from Mr Jocaille this morning ( please consider this when looking at the tender)\\n\\n· Amy called me at 18.40 to inform me that Catia ( cleaner ) had not arrived. Expected time 18.00\\n\\n· I informed Manuel Balesteros\\n\\n· He arrived with 2 new cleaners at 18.45\\n\\nCoupled with the incident last Saturday concerning the alarm being set off, in my opinion, these are both considered as serious misconduct in terms of his contractual role profile and we would like to replace this security guard immediately.\\n\\nIn terms of communication and managing the security contracts we would like to understand the level of responsibility that Romain & Pierre have as facilities assistants. Do Romain & Pierre understand the hierarchy here?\\n\\nThese are serious issues which we have felt obliged to report but we do not appreciate that Romain replies with an email telling Amy to reiterate the alarm procedures.

His main concern seemed to be that we may be held responsible\\nfor H&S issues in partner venues where we bring UK participants, artists or\\nconsultants to take part in programmes.\\n\\nMy position is that we work with partners and partner venues who take\\nresponsibility for this. We work with a very high number of venues and it\\nwould be impossible for us to carry out a risk assessment on each one.\\nFrance’s H&S legislation is equal to the UK’s, and governed by the same EU\\nregulations. I am aware that this does not rule out any negligence, but we\\nare working with respected organisations and I judge the level of risk to\\nbe pretty low.\\n\\nI wrote to Daniel to request whether the UK can provide standard\\ninformation to ensure this is written into our contractual arrangements\\nwith UK participants/artists, and with partner venues as well. I am\\nattaching my e-mail about that. I have had no reply. Of course we can try\\nto draft our own clauses, but it is disappointing that the ERM team cannot\\nprovide basic resources of this kind.\\n\\nThe only risk assessment we can feasibly carry out in this way is the\\nbuilding itself for the events we occasionally hold in the Turner room. If\\nthis is not covered by the work you are doing on behalf of the TC, then Amy\\nMcFarlane will be able to work with you to carry out a risk assessment.\\n\\nBest wishes,\\nJulia\\n\\n << Message: RE: Health and Safety audit, initial action points >>\\n\\n_____________________________________________\\n*From:* Smuts, Michael (France)\\n*Sent:* 22 July 2013 16:00\\n*To:* Nguyen, Thomas (France); Handelman-Smith, Julia (France)\\n*Cc:* Burlton, Andrew (France); Gelis, Sylvie (France)\\n*Subject:* FW: H&S audit: urgent requirement to carry out risk assessments\\n\\n\\nDear Thomas, Julia,\\n\\nPlease can you give me an update on the email below?

It\'s a good location for us but only 1st floor (so pretty close to the market when that\'s on) no balconies and really needs new bathrooms so it seems very expensive right now but hasn\'t been let despite being on the market for over 3 months (I saw it in November and it was already empty then). This is the email i sent him but haven\'t had a reply to. His mobile is 06 12 80 49 64 and he seems very approachable. His name is Monsieur Lefebure\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nRachel\\n\\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\\nFrom: Rachel Wheatley <wheatley.rachel@gmail.com>\\nDate: 2015-02-05 23:07 GMT+01:00\\nSubject: Re: visite 16heures\\nTo: CARNOT IMMOBILIER <carnot-immobilier@wanadoo.fr>\\n\\nCher Monsieu Lefébure,\\n\\nMerci pour le visite a 30 Ave de Saxe aujourd hui. Nous sommes intéressants à cet appartement, mais il me semble très cher par rapport aux autres sur le marché actuellement. Notre position est que nous sommes à la recherche pour une longue appartement terme être utilisée par le Directeur du British Council et les directeurs successifs. L\'appartement actuelle que nous vivons a été loué à une compagnie d\'assurance (qui a vendu il ya deux ans pour dvelopers de propriété) depuis plus de 40 ans, donc cette continuité offre une excellente proposition financière pour un propriétaire qui souhaite revenu continu, sans périodes vides. Notre appartement au moment a été loué en cours depuis plus de 40 ans et dans ce temps, il a été très bien entretenu et amélioré par le British Council depuis qu\'ils ont commencé louaient.\\n\\nJ\'ai expliqué que nous étions sur le point de signer le contrat sur un apartment de très bonne qualité, récemment rénové, détenue par une compagnie d\'assurance, sur l\'avenue de la Bourdonnais, mais malgré ses cinq chambres et 3 receptions, il a relativement petite cuisine. Il se rendit d\'abord sur le marché il ya au moins 10 mois pour € 6000 cc (chauffage et l\'eau chaud) mais ils ont baissé le prix de € 4100 + 750charges (l\'eau chaud et chauffage inclus) et nous ont offert une période de loyer gratuit pour se adapter à une cuisine. J\'aime l\'appartement au 30, avenue de Saxe, mais il se sent un peu plus petit (avez vous un bon plan pour vérifier le m2?) et ne est pas aussi immaculée que celui sur Bourdonnais mais c\'est près de l\'école de mon fils et pas loin du British Council (Rue Constantine). Nous pouvons rester dans notre appartement actuel jusqu\'à ce que Mars 2016 mais également nous pouvons partir immédiatement (préavis d\'un mois). J\'ai vu un autre grand appartement sur l\'avenue de Saxe laquelle l\'agent a été incapable de louer pour plusieurs mois à € 4500 en dépit d\'être bien sur le 4ème étage et très lumineux et calme. L\'agent m\'a dit qu\'ils aimeraient négocier mais je pense qu\'il y a peut être trop de travail à faire là-bas. Avec l\'appartement au 30, avenue de Saxe je crois qu\'il y a moins de travail, mais nous aimerions repolir parquet, repeindre où nécessaire , adapter à une bonne douche de qualité et d\'améliorer une salle de bains en général, et aussi améliorer une WC pour les invitees. Nous ne pouvons pas payer plus que nous avons actuellement mis d\'accord sur l\'appartement de Bourdonnais mais ce est avec tout charges comprises. Pouvez-vous confirmer ce qui est inclus dans les charges de 30 Ave Saxe et comment cher vous envisager chauffage au gaz et de l\'eau chaude pour être si elles ne sont pas inclus se il vous plaît? Nous sommes une famille avec un enfant de 6 ans. Si le propriétaire est heureux de discuter de l\'amélioration de l\'appartement dans une manière coopérative et amicable avec nous (nous avons constructeurs employées par le British Council qui nous pourrions utiliser) et serait prêt à abaisser le loyer nous serions interesees de parler avec vous. Si oui, est-ce mon mari peut voir l\'appartement aussitôt que possible?\\n\\nCordialement\\n\\nRachel Wheatley\\n\\n2014-12-01 10:57 GMT+01:00 Rachel Wheatley <wheatley.rachel@gmail.com>:\\n\\nMerci pour le visite a Avenue Saxe.

There are a couple of invoices still to come in so I\'ll write back with an updated version shortly. \\n\\nBy way of explanation: it would have been very difficult to have asked providers to charge each institution separately. I therefore calculated each organisation\'s share of the cost as a percentage of the cost of the works falling in BC or Common areas. ULIP\'s 50% share of costs for common areas works out to be 27% of total works. I\'ve therefore applied that percentage to all costs except where the asset or service was clearly shared (ex. lifts).\\n\\nPlease do come back to me if you have any queries.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nMichael","priority":"urgent","status":"open","recipient":null,"requester_id":521129881,"submitter_id":305301966,"assignee_id":305301966,"organization_id":27580802,"group_id":20538918,"collaborator_ids":[355060461,345333241],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":"2015-02-20T12:00:00Z","tags":["late"],"custom_fields":[{"id":22099756,"value":""},{"id":22175783,"value":null},{"id":23188653,"value":""},{"id":23196818,"value":""},{"id":22189271,"value":""},{"id":22196978,"value":""},{"id":22280801,"value":""},{"id":22191376,"value":null},{"id":22001027,"value":""},{"id":22786313,"value":null},{"id":22609382,"value":null},{"id":23059781,"value":null},{"id":23059791,"value":""},{"id":23060832,"value":false},{"id":23059811,"value":""},{"id":23060101,"value":null},{"id":23060111,"value":null},{"id":23059381,"value":null},{"id":23059391,"value":""},{"id":23059401,"value":""},{"id":23059411,"value":null},{"id":23060722,"value":null},{"id":25646602,"value":null},{"id":25646612,"value":null},{"id":25624601,"value":null},{"id":25420591,"value":""},{"id":25625411,"value":null},{"id":25625671,"value":null},{"id":25625421,"value":null},{"id":25625681,"value":null},{"id":25663832,"value":null},{"id":24296541,"value":"1830"},{"id":24296551,"value":"64"},{"id":25420671,"value":""},{"id":25742742,"value":""},{"id":25625501,"value":null},{"id":25625511,"value":null},{"id":25442472,"value":""},{"id":25646512,"value":null},{"id":25871542,"value":""},{"id":25646522,"value":null},{"id":25722821,"value":""},{"id":25646541,"value":null},{"id":25686752,"value":""},{"id":25823732,"value":""},{"id":25625591,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":{"score":"unoffered"},"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":22099756,"value":""},{"id":22175783,"value":null},{"id":23188653,"value":""},{"id":23196818,"value":""},{"id":22189271,"value":""},{"id":22196978,"value":""},{"id":22280801,"value":""},{"id":22191376,"value":null},{"id":22001027,"value":""},{"id":22786313,"value":null},{"id":22609382,"value":null},{"id":23059781,"value":null},{"id":23059791,"value":""},{"id":23060832,"value":false},{"id":23059811,"value":""},{"id":23060101,"value":null},{"id":23060111,"value":null},{"id":23059381,"value":null},{"id":23059391,"value":""},{"id":23059401,"value":""},{"id":23059411,"value":null},{"id":23060722,"value":null},{"id":25646602,"value":null},{"id":25646612,"value":null},{"id":25624601,"value":null},{"id":25420591,"value":""},{"id":25625411,"value":null},{"id":25625671,"value":null},{"id":25625421,"value":null},{"id":25625681,"value":null},{"id":25663832,"value":null},{"id":24296541,"value":"1830"},{"id":24296551,"value":"64"},{"id":25420671,"value":""},{"id":25742742,"value":""},{"id":25625501,"value":null},{"id":25625511,"value":null},{"id":25442472,"value":""},{"id":25646512,"value":null},{"id":25871542,"value":""},{"id":25646522,"value":null},{"id":25722821,"value":""},{"id":25646541,"value":null},{"id":25686752,"value":""},{"id":25823732,"value":""},{"id":25625591,"value":null}],"ticket_form_id":4433,"brand_id":125291}}',

I suggest that we ask the landlord whether he would be prepared to extend our current lease ending in September 2015 for a further two years and 1 month until 31 October 2017. This would provide continuity for the family and avoid a costly move for the BC to another flat for a further two years. For us the natural break moment is 31 October 2017. I would be grateful if you could approach the landlord formally to seek this extension.\\n\\nIf the landlord is not willing to grant an extension and we have no legal recourse to challenge that, then we will need to search for a new place.\\n\\nThe first step would be to contact the Embassy. I know that they have a ‘representational’ flat becoming available soon when Michael Ward the current Head of UKTI in Paris moves on. I believe they are not replacing him with another ‘representational’ post. I may not have got the details right, but it may be the embassy would be willing to keep the flat and rent it to us. (It would be worth making the enquiry now at the same time we are asking the landlord about an extension).\\n\\nIf these two options are not possible then we need to start the search process for a new flat.\\n\\nThe key factors for us are the location of the office and the location of my son’s school in terms of where we look. We would like to be within reasonable distance of both. Benjie’s school is\\n\\nAt 3 Rue de Villars just behind Les Invalides. So, I guess this means we start with the 7th.\\n\\nWe can work out a precise specification required once we know we have to move.\\n\\nLet me know if anything is unclear or you need more information.\\n\\nPaul\\n\\nPaul Docherty | Director | British Council | 9 rue de Constantine | 75340 Paris Cedex 07 | France\\nT +33 (0)1 49 55 73 24 | BCTN 271 7324 | M +33 (0)6 72 40 11 64 | F +33 (0)1 47 05 77 02\\nwww.britishcouncil.fr (http://www.britishcouncil.fr/)\\n\\nThe British Council is the United Kingdom\'s international organisation for cultural relations and educational opportunities.
