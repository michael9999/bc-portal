<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>
<p>-Louis Reingold</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>
<p>-Louis Reingold</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

We then sprinkled all post formats, 8 layouts including magazine and blog, powdered 40+ social icons and even blended in a customizable top bar for extra density. We also made it translation ready and gave it RTL language support for some cultural diversity. The secret ingredient was love and we might\'ve spilled too much of that.

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>
<p>-Louis Reingold</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

We then sprinkled all post formats, 8 layouts including magazine and blog, powdered 40+ social icons and even blended in a customizable top bar for extra density. We also made it translation ready and gave it RTL language support for some cultural diversity. The secret ingredient was love and we might\'ve spilled too much of that.

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

We then sprinkled all post formats, 8 layouts including magazine and blog, powdered 40+ social icons and even blended in a customizable top bar for extra density. We also made it translation ready and gave it RTL language support for some cultural diversity. The secret ingredient was love and we might\'ve spilled too much of that.

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

We then sprinkled all post formats, 8 layouts including magazine and blog, powdered 40+ social icons and even blended in a customizable top bar for extra density. We also made it translation ready and gave it RTL language support for some cultural diversity. The secret ingredient was love and we might\'ve spilled too much of that.

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>

<p>I’m Louis Reingold, the founder of Soflyy. We are the creators of WP All Import.</p>
<p>The team here consists of Max on WP All Import code, Antonio on support, Pete on other development, and me on product design and everything else.</p>
<p>You can find me in person at the Hollywood WordPress meetup in Los Angeles every month, or once a year at Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Francisco WordCamps.</p>
<p>Doing data imports to WordPress can be a complicated process. My goal with WP All Import is to make importing XML and CSV files to WordPress as simple and straightforward as possible.</p>
<p>My favorite thing is when people come up to me at WordCamps and tell me how many hours WP All Import saved them, so please come say hi at a WordCamp or meetup!</p>
